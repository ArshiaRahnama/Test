-- NOTE ABOUT THE TEXTS IN THIS FILE
-- Many labels below are written in Portuguese ON PURPOSE (device colours, shop texts, Eats menus,
-- services, map places...): they are the translation keys of the phone, which shows each one in the
-- language chosen by the player (15 languages). The English text is given in a trailing "-- EN:"
-- comment. If you replace a label with your own text it is shown exactly as you write it, in every
-- language.

-- 'auto' detects in this order: qbx_core (QBox) > qb-core (QBCore) > es_extended (ESX).
-- Force it with 'qb' | 'qbx' | 'esx' if you have more than one started.
-- 'standalone' = NO framework: the identity is the player's license, the name is the FiveM name, the job is
-- 'unemployed', the number lives only in apex_phone_accounts and money only exists if you wire up the hooks
-- in Config.Standalone (below). Admin = ACE 'apex_phone.admin'. 'auto' NEVER falls back to standalone
-- on its own (on a QB server with qb-core stopped it would create new accounts keyed by license).
-- A forced value ('qb' | 'qbx' | 'esx' | 'standalone') applies on BOTH sides: the client uses it too.

--            the settings, silently, for anyone using a wallpaper taken from Photos
-- ⚠️ DO NOT RELY ON THE `settings` CAP: 400 000 NEVER triggers. A FiveM network event cannot carry

-- the settings of players with wallpapers taken from Photos. The fix is to move the base64 out of

-- Retention: how many DAYS to keep the tables that only ever grew (0 = never delete, for any key).
-- Notifications have their own cleanup above; so do media, stories and darkchat. These
-- had none. The cleanup runs every `minutes` minutes, starting 2 minutes after startup, and
-- deletes in chunks of `batch` rows, with a pause between them, so it never locks a large table.
-- It NEVER deletes what is still in progress: unpaid bills (pending), undelivered Eats orders
-- and Onion orders with money or an item held in escrow stay where they are.
-- ⚠️ THIS DELETES PLAYER DATA, PERMANENTLY AND IRREVERSIBLY. That is why it ships ALL AT ZERO (disabled): a
-- server that already has players must not lose anything just by updating the phone. Enable what you
-- want, one key at a time, and watch the console (Config.Debug = true shows how many rows were removed).
-- Values we recommend when you decide to enable it, from most to least useful:
--   posts = 180 · calls = 90 · transactions = 180 · bills = 180 · services = 14
--   eatsOrders = 30 · onionOrders = 90 · maxPostsPerAccount = 200 · messages = 0 (leave at 0)
-- ⚠️ Before enabling: the first pass runs 2 minutes after startup and deletes ALL history that
-- is already past the limit in one go (on a server that is years old that is a lot of rows). Back up the database.
--   posts        Instashot/Tweeter/Reels posts (the full image as base64 in a LONGTEXT: this is the
--                fastest-growing table). When deleted, their likes/comments/saves are removed too, as well as
--                REPLIES left without a post (with no parent they would never show to anyone again and
--                would keep taking up rows and counting towards maxPostsPerAccount). A REPOST whose
--                original was deleted STAYS: it still shows in the feed, just without the original's block.
--                ⚠️ this is the accounts' photo wall: deleting by age removes their old photos
--   messages     SMS and Recado chats. Leave at 0: it is the same table as Recado chats, and deleting
--                an old chat means losing content, not a log entry. If you enable it, this is what happens
--                to anything pointing at message ids (verified by reading the code, not in game):
--                · Recado reactions and marks (stars, pins, already-opened "view once") are
--                  deleted with the messages (orphan sweeper in server/main.lua)
--                · each group's last message (apex_phone_conversations.last_id) is repointed to the
--                  remaining message, or left empty if none remains: the group stays in the list,
--                  with no preview and sorted by its creation date
--                · each member's "unread" marker (last_read_id) needs no fix: it is a watermark

--                · a pinned or starred message deleted by age disappears from those lists, as
--                  expected, but it is content the player had saved on purpose
--   calls        call history
--   transactions entries shown in the Bank app (the money itself belongs to the framework, it is not stored here)

-- EATS: food delivery ("Eats" app, in the style of Glovo / Uber Eats)
--
-- How it works:
--   1. The player picks a restaurant, fills the cart and places the order.
--   2. The order is charged (bank account or cash) and goes to the kitchen.
--   3. Every player in COURIER MODE within Eats.courierRadius receives the offer.
--      The first to accept gets it. If nobody accepts within `npcAfter` seconds,
--      an NPC courier steps in and the order still arrives (the server never gets stuck).
--   4. States: pending > accepted > preparing > picked > delivering > delivered.
--      The customer sees the map with the courier moving and the estimated time.
--   5. The courier receives `courierCutPct` % of the delivery fee + 100 % of the tip.
--
-- Restaurants with a `job` set belong to players: whoever is on duty
-- in that job receives the orders in the app and the food money goes to the society.
-- Without `job`, the restaurant is "NPC" and the money leaves the economy (like a shop).

-- ------------------------------------------------------------
-- PHYSICAL SIM CARDS (off by default). server/psim.lua + client/psim.lua + html/js/apps/psim.js
-- On: the phone NUMBER lives on a 'sim_card' item (metadata { iccid, number }) that sits in the SIM tray of a phone item.
--   * Whoever's phone holds the SIM uses that number (calls, SMS, Zapp, caller ID) and receives its calls/messages.
--     Move the SIM to another phone and the number goes with it. A phone without a SIM shows "No SIM" (no calls, no SMS)
--     but still opens: every app that does not need a number keeps working.
--   * Data ON the phone stays with the phone: contacts, photos, notes, settings/wallpaper, passcode/Face Key, call history,
--     notifications, app layout. Messages (they follow the number), group chats, social accounts, bank and bills stay
--     "in the cloud" exactly as before.
--   * This also turns on phone ownership (Config.StolenPhones, its options still apply): a phone belongs to the first
--     character who used it, and using somebody else's phone opens THEIR phone behind THEIR lock screen (passcode only,
--     Face Key never works for another person). Putting it away locks it again but it stays the phone in your hand.
--   * The phone in your hand = the last phone you used (the open key opens that one); use another phone item to switch.
--   * Insert / eject: Settings > Mobile Service (PearOS) or Connections > SIM manager (Nova UI), or use a SIM card item
--     (goes into the phone in your hand; if that phone already has a SIM they swap and the old one goes to your inventory).
--   * Existing characters lose nothing: the first time they are seen with a phone their number becomes a SIM inside it
--     (extra eSIM lines become SIM cards in the inventory).
--   * 1.3.0 - LOST / STOLEN number (recover): a number belongs to the character it was issued to (shop, migration, starter
--     SIM, eSIM card, /givesim). When that card is not in the player's hands any more (phone stolen, lost, destroyed), Settings >
--     Mobile Service (PearOS) / SIM manager (Nova UI) shows "Recover my number": the carrier cancels the old card for good and
--     hands out a new SIM card with the SAME number (messages, calls and - with contactsOnSim - the contacts come back), put
--     straight into the phone in hand when its tray is empty. Whoever still has the old card loses the number at once and
--     inserting it says "cancelled by the carrier". Admins: /givesim [id] [number] re-issues a number that belongs to that
--     character for free. Server event apex_phone:simRecovered (src, number, oldIccid, newIccid); export RecoverSimCard(src, number).
--   * 1.3.0 - contactsOnSim: the CONTACTS live on the card too (apex_phone_contacts owner "sim:<number>"): whoever has the
--     card in a phone sees them, and they survive a lost phone and a re-issued card. The first time a card is used with this on,
--     the contacts of the account it belongs to are COPIED onto it (the phone keeps its own copy). false = contacts stay with
--     the phone (the device owner's account), exactly as in 1.2.0.
-- Needs ox_inventory (any framework) or qb-inventory / ps-inventory / lj-inventory (QBCore), and Config.RequireItem = true.
-- Without them it switches itself off with a console warning. Off = everything exactly as before.
-- Inventory: add 'sim_card' from inventory_items.lua (image inventory_images/sim_card.png). Admin: /givesim [id] [number].
-- The admin panel (/phoneadmin > Phone > Physical SIM) can switch it on or off: restart Unique_Phone afterwards.
